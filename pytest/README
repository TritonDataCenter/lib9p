Here are some very skeletal instructions for using
the client test code.

on server (assumes BSD style LD_LIBRARY_PATH):

mkdir /tmp/foo
cd lib9p
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. example/server -h localhost -p 12345 /tmp/foo

(this can be run as a non-root user for now, but some things
only work when run as root)

on client (same machine as server, but can always be run as
non-root user):

cd lib9p/pytest
./client.py

TODO: rework ./client so it can locate the .ini file
